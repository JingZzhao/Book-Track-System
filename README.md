# Book-Track-System

The system’s goal is providing a platform to track books. The book has 2 statues:
checked out or in stock. If a book is in “checked out” statue, the book shall have been
checked out by a teacher or staff to a student. If a book is in “in stock” statue, the book can
be checked out by a teacher or staff to a student who can borrow books. (A student can’t
borrow books if he/she has already checked out book in numbers of classes he/she is
registered for). Our system will store data for where the book is ( in student or in library).

Aside of tracking books, our system provide security to access the system. All user need
to log in by using their ID and userId before they use services of our system . There are 3
types of user in our system: student, staff and teachers. And for different user, they have
different access level and according to user’s access level, they enjoy different service.
